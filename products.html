				<div class="scroll_content_msg">
					<p>
						Like other precious metals, gold is measured by troy weight and by grams. When it is alloyed with other metals the term carat or karat is used to indicate the purity of gold present, with 24 carats being pure gold and lower ratings proportionally less. The purity of a gold bar or coin can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1, known as the millesimal fineness, such as 0.995 being very pure. Trident mainly offers Gold Bullion bars 99.99% 24 Carats starting from 250 grams.

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="scroll_content_msg">
					<p>
						Platinum, along with the rest of the platinum metals, is obtained commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper mining and processing. During electro refining of copper, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals, as well as selenium and tellurium, settle to the bottom of the cell as “anode mud”, which forms the starting point for the extraction of the platinum group metals.
					</p>
					<p>
						If pure platinum is found in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is also non- magnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both magnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulphuric acids, while other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in either of the two acids and recovering the remaining platinum. Ronca Holding offers

						Copper is mostly used as a metal, but when a higher hardness is required it is combined with other elements to make an alloy (5% of total use) such as brass and bronze. A small part of copper supply is used in production of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture.

					<p>
						Nickel is used in many specific and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, and special alloys. It is also used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in the nickel steels and nickel cast irons, of which there are many varieties. It is also widely used in many other alloys, such as nickel brasses and bronzes, and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold

						<h2>Tin</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="scroll_content_msg">
					<p>
						Tin is the 49th most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, representing 2 ppm compared with 75 ppm for zinc, 50 ppm for copper, and 14 ppm for lead. Tin does not occur naturally by itself, and must be extracted from a base compound, usually cassiterite (SnO2), the only commercially important source of tin, although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex sulfides such as stannite, cylindrite, franckeite, canfieldite, and teallite.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tin is one of the earliest known metals. Late Stone Age metal-workers discovered that by putting a small amount of tin, about 5%, in molten copper produced an alloy called bronze that was easier to work with, and much harder than copper. This discovery so revolutionized civilization that any culture that made widespread use of bronze to make tools and weapons became part of what archaeologists call the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age arrived in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley culture by around 3000 BC.

						<h2>Zinc</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="scroll_content_msg">
					<p>
						This metal is most commonly used as an anti-corrosion agent. Galvanization, which is the coating of iron or steel to protect the metals against corrosion, is the most familiar form of using zinc. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.
					</p>
					<p>
						Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2) forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched, but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.
					</p>
					<p>
						The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion. A zinc disc attached to a ship’s iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays unattacked. Other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller, or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship.

					<p>
						Because of its high density and resistance from corrosion, lead is used for the ballast keel of sailboats. Its high density allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails while at the same time occupying a small volume and thus offering the least underwater resistance. For the same reason, it is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver’s natural buoyancy and that of his equipment. It does not have the weight-to-volume ratio of many heavy metals, but its low cost increases its use in these and other applications.

						Lead is used in applications where its low melting point, ductility and high density is an advantage. The low melting point makes casting of lead easy, and therefore small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment. It is also less expensive and denser than other common metals. The hot metal typesetting uses a lead based alloy to produce the types for printing directly before printing. Its corrosion resistance makes it suitable for outdoor applications when in contact with water.

						<h2>Sugar</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="scroll_content_msg">
					<p>
						Sugar is the generalized name for a class of sweet-flavored substances used as food. They are carbohydrates and as this name implies, are composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharide’s and include glucose, fructose and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most commonly used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants but are only present in sufficient concentrations for efficient extraction in sugarcane and sugar beet. Sugarcane is a giant grass and has been cultivated in tropical climates in the Far East since ancient times. A great expansion in its production took place in the 18th century with the setting up of sugar plantations in the West Indies and Americas. This was the first time that sugar became available to the common people who had previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. Sugar beet is a root crop and is cultivated in cooler climates and became a major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. Sugar production and trade has changed the course of human history in many ways. It influenced the formation of colonies, the perpetuation of slavery, the transition to indentured labor, the migration of people, wars between 19th century sugar trade controlling nations, and the ethnic composition and political structure of the new world.
					</p>
					<p>
						The world produced about 168 million tonnes of sugar in 2011.

						<h2>Vegetable Fats and Oils</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="scroll_content_msg">
					<p>
						 lipid materials derived from plants. Physically, oils are liquid at room temperature, and fats are solid. Chemically, both fats and oils are composed of triglycerides, as contrasted with waxes which lack glycerin in their structure. Although many plant parts may yield oil, in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily from seeds.
					</p>
					<p>
						The melting temperature distinction between oils and fats is imprecise, since definitions of room temperature vary, and typically natural oils have a melting range instead of a single melting point since natural oils are not chemically homogeneous. Although thought of as esters of glycerin and a varying blend of fatty acids, fats and oils also typically contain free fatty acids, monoglyceride’s and diglycerides, and unsaponifiable lipids.
					</p>
					<p>
						Vegetable fats and oils may or may not be edible. Examples of inedible vegetable fats and oils include processed linseed oil, tung oil, and castor oil used in lubricants and paints. Oils extracted from plants have been used since ancient times and in many cultures.
					</p>
					<h3>Culinary uses</h3>
					<p>
						Many vegetable oils are consumed directly, or indirectly as ingredients in food – a role that they share with some animal fats, including butter and ghee. The oils serve a number of purposes in this role:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="content_li"><span>Shortening - </span>to give pastry a crumbly texture.</li>
						<li class="content_li"><span>Texture - </span>oils can serve to make other ingredients stick together less.</li>
						<li class="content_li"><span>Flavor - </span>while less-flavorful oils command premium prices, some oils such as olive, sesame, or almond oil, may be chosen specifically for the flavor they impart.</li>
						<li class="content_li"><span>Flavor Base - </span>oils can also “carry” flavors of other ingredients, since many flavors are present in chemicals that are soluble in oil.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Secondly, oils can be heated and used to cook other foods. Oils suitable for this purpose must have a high flash point. Such oils include the major cooking oils – soybean, canola, sunflower, safflower, peanut, cottonseed, etc. Tropical oils, such as coconut, palm, and rice bran oils, are particularly valued in Asian cultures for high temperature cooking, because of their unusually high flash point.
					</p>
					<h3>Hydrogenated oils</h3>
					<p>Unsaturated vegetable fats and oils can be transformed through partial or complete “hydrogenation” into fats and oils of higher melting point. The hydrogenation process involves “sparging” the oil at high temperature and pressure with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, typically a powdered nickel compound. As each carbon- carbon double-bond is chemically reduced to a single bond, two hydrogen atoms each form single bonds with the two carbon atoms. The elimination of double bonds by adding hydrogen atoms is called saturation; as the degree of saturation increases, the oil progresses toward being fully hydrogenated. An oil may be hydrogenated to increase resistance to rancidity (oxidation) or to change its physical characteristics. As the degree of saturation increases, the oil’s viscosity and melting point increase.</p>
					<p>The use of hydrogenated oils in foods has never been completely satisfactory. Because the centre arm of the triglyceride is shielded somewhat by the end fatty acids, most of the hydrogenation occurs on the end fatty acids, thus making the resulting fat more brittle. A margarine made from naturally more saturated oils will be more plastic (more “spreadable”) than a margarine made from hydrogenated soy oil. While full hydrogenation produces largely saturated fatty acids, partial hydrogenation results in the transformation of unsaturated cis fatty acids to trans fatty acids in the oil mixture due to the heat used in hydrogenation. Since the 1970s, partially hydrogenated oils and their trans fats have increasingly been viewed as unhealthy.</p>
					<p>In the U.S., the Standard of Identity for a product labeled as “vegetable oil margarine” specifies only canola, safflower, sunflower, corn, soybean, or peanut oil may be used. Products not labeled “vegetable oil margarine” do not have that restriction.</p>
					<h3>Industrial uses</h3>
					<p>Vegetable oils are used as an ingredient or component in many manufactured products. Many vegetable oils are used to make soaps, skin products, candles, perfumes and other personal care and cosmetic products. Some oils are particularly suitable as drying oils, and are used in making paints and other wood treatment products. Dammar oil (a mixture of linseed oil and dammar resin), for example, is used almost exclusively in treating the hulls of wooden boats. Vegetable oils are increasingly being used in the electrical industry as insulators as vegetable oils are not toxic to the environment, biodegradable if spilled and have high flash and fire points. However, vegetable oils are less stable chemically, so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen, and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate. Synthetic tetraesters, which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester, are manufactured by Fischer esterification. Tetraesters generally have high stability to oxidation and have found use as engine lubricants. Vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid and lubricant.</p>
					<p>
						One limiting factor in industrial uses of vegetable oils is that all such oils eventually chemically decompose, turning rancid. Oils that are more stable, such as ben oil or mineral oil, are preferred for some industrial uses. Vegetable-based oils, like castor oil, have been used as medicine and as lubricants for a long time. Castor oil has numerous industrial uses, primarily due to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the fatty acid chains. Castor oil, and other vegetable oils which have been chemically modified to contain hydroxyl groups, are becoming increasingly important in the production of polyurethane plastic for many applications. These modified vegetable oils are known as natural oil polyols.

					<h3>Pet Food Additive</h3>
					<p>Vegetable oil is used in production of some pet foods. AAFCO defines vegetable oil, in this context, as the product of vegetable origin obtained by extracting the oil from seeds or fruits which are processed for edible purposes. In some poorer grade pet foods, the oil is listed only as “vegetable oil”, without specifying the particular oil.</p>
					<h3>Fuel</h3>
					<p>
						Vegetable oils are also used to make biodiesel, which can be used like conventional diesel. Some vegetable oil blends are used in unmodified vehicles but straight vegetable oil, also known as pure plant oil, needs specially prepared vehicles which have a method of heating the oil to reduce its viscosity. The vegetable oil economy is growing and the availability of biodiesel around the world is increasing.
					</p>
					<p>
						The NNFCC estimate that the total net greenhouse gas savings when using vegetable oils in place of fossil fuel- based alternatives for fuel production, range from 18 to 100%.

					<h3>Production</h3>

						cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other industrial applications.

						A spice is a dried seed, fruit, root, bark, or vegetative substance primarily used for flavoring, coloring or preserving food. Sometimes a spice is used to hide other flavors.Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are parts of leafy green plants also used for flavoring or as garnish.Many spices have antimicrobial properties. This may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climates, which have more infectious disease, and why use of spices is especially prominent in meat, which is particularly susceptible to spoiling.
					</p>
					<p>
						A spice may have an extra use, usually medicinal, religious ritual, cosmetics or perfume production, or as a vegetable. For example, turmeric roots are consumed as a vegetable and garlic as an antibiotic.
